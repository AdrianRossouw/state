This project is an experimental rewrite of the **State.js** library.

* Abandons the faux-secure privileged model and use of dynamically generated instance methods

* Embraces more strict conventionally prototypal model, performing fast bit-field checks per method invocation

* Expects considerable improvements in time and space complexity at runtime,  better expressiveness and reduced complexity of the codebase, and reduction in the size of the overall payload

* Written in literate coffeescript, with markdown similarly ready to feed into the documentation pipeline as soon as itâ€™s ready

* * *
