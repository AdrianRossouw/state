## [State](#state)

A `State` models a set of behaviors on behalf of an owner object. The owner may undergo **transitions** that change its **current** state from one to another, and in so doing adopt a different set of behaviors.

Distinct behaviors are modeled in each state by defining a set of method overrides, to which calls made on the owner will be redirected so long as a state remains current.

States are structured as a rooted tree, where **substates** inherit from a single **superstate**. While a substate is current, it and all of its ancestor superstates are **active**.

In addition, a state also recognizes the owner objectâ€™s prototypal inheritance, identifying an identically named and positioned state in the prototype as its **protostate**. Stateful behavior is inherited from protostates first, then from superstates.
