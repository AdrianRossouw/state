// ## State <a class="icon-link" name="state" href="#state"></a>
// 
// A **state** models a set of behaviors on behalf of an owner object. The
// owner may undergo **transitions** that change its **current** state from
// one to another, and in so doing adopt a different set of behaviors.
// 
// Distinct behaviors are modeled in each state by defining a set of method
// overrides, to which calls made on the owner will be redirected so long as a
// state remains current.
// 
// States are structured as a rooted tree, where **substates** inherit from a
// single **superstate**. While a substate is current, it and all of its
// ancestor superstates are considered to be **active**.
// 
// In addition, a state also recognizes the owner objectâ€™s prototypal
// inheritance, identifying an identically named and positioned state in the
// prototype as its **protostate**. Stateful behavior is inherited *from
// protostates first*, then from superstates.
